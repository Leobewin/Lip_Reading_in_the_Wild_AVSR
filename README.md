## Audio-Visual Speech Recognition using Deep Learning

Work done during [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com)
- ```SyncNet\``` : Current speaker recognition in the video frame using Deep Learning, without any labelled speaker data, described in the paper, [Out of time: automated lip sync in the wild (SyncNet)](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/lipsync/)

- ```LRW_Sentences\``` : AVSR model described in the paper, [Lip Reading Sentences in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05358)
